abstract = {A number of successful systemic therapies are available for treatment of disseminated cancers. However, tumor response is often transient, and therapy frequently fails due to emergence of resistant populations. The latter reflects the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment as well as the evolutionary capacity of cancer phenotypes to adapt to therapeutic perturbations. Although cancers are highly dynamic systems, cancer therapy is typically administered according to a fixed, linear protocol. Here we examine an adaptive therapeutic approach that evolves in response to the temporal and spatial variability of tumor microenvironment and cellular phenotype as well as therapy-induced perturbations. Initial mathematical models find that when resistant phenotypes arise in the untreated tumor, they are typically present in small numbers because they are less fit than the sensitive population. This reflects the "cost" of phenotypic resistance such as additional substrate and energy used to up-regulate xenobiotic metabolism, and therefore not available for proliferation, or the growth inhibitory nature of environments (i.e., ischemia or hypoxia) that confer resistance on phenotypically sensitive cells. Thus, in the Darwinian environment of a cancer, the fitter chemosensitive cells will ordinarily proliferate at the expense of the less fit chemoresistant cells. The models show that, if resistant populations are present before administration of therapy, treatments designed to kill maximum numbers of cancer cells remove this inhibitory effect and actually promote more rapid growth of the resistant populations. We present an alternative approach in which treatment is continuously modulated to achieve a fixed tumor population. The goal of adaptive therapy is to enforce a stable tumor burden by permitting a significant population of chemosensitive cells to survive so that they, in turn, suppress proliferation of the less fit but chemoresistant subpopulations. Computer simulations show that this strategy can result in prolonged survival that is substantially greater than that of high dose density or metronomic therapies. The feasibility of adaptive therapy is supported by in vivo experiments. {\textcopyright}2009 American Association for Cancer Research.},

abstract = {When resistance to anticancer or antimicrobial drugs evolves in a patient, highly effective chemotherapy can fail, threatening patient health and lifespan. Standard practice is to treat aggressively, effectively eliminating drug-sensitive target cells as quickly as possible. This prevents sensitive cells from acquiring resistance de novo but also eliminates populations that can competitively suppress resistant populations. Here we analyse that evolutionary trade-off and consider recent suggestions that treatment regimens aimed at containing rather than eliminating tumours or infections might more effectively delay the emergence of resistance. Our general mathematical analysis shows that there are situations in which regimens aimed at containment will outperform standard practice even if there is no fitness cost of resistance, and, in those cases, the time to treatment failure can be more than doubled. But, there are also situations in which containment will make a bad prognosis worse. Our analysis identifies thresholds that define these situations and thus can guide treatment decisions. The analysis also suggests a variety of interventions that could be used in conjunction with cytotoxic drugs to inhibit the emergence of resistance. Fundamental principles determine, across a wide range of disease settings, the circumstances under which standard practice best delays resistance emergence—and when it can be bettered.},

@article{Strobl2020c,
abstract = {1 Abstract "Control and conquer"-this is the philosophy behind adaptive therapy (AT), which seeks to exploit intra-tumoral competition to avoid, or at least, delay the emergence of therapy resistance in cancer. Motivated by promising results from theoretical, experimental and, most recently, clinical studies, there is an increasing interest in extending this approach to other cancers. As such, it is urgent to understand the characteristics of a cancer which determine whether it will respond well to AT, or not. A plausible candidate for such a selection criterion is the fitness cost of resistance. In this paper, we study a 2-population ordinary differential equation (ODE) model to investigate whether the presence of a cost is a necessary condition for AT to extend the time to progression beyond that of a standard-of-care continuous therapy. We find that for tumours close to their environmental carrying capacity such a cost of resistance is not required. However, for tumours growing far from carrying capacity a cost may be required to see meaningful gains. Notably, we show that in such cases it is important to consider the cell turnover in the tumour and we discuss its role in modulating the impact of a cost of resistance. Overall, our work helps to clarify under which circumstances AT may be beneficial, and suggests that turnover may play an unexpectedly important role in the decision making process.},

abstract = {Adaptive therapy (AT) aims to control tumour burden by maintaining therapy-sensitive cells to exploit their competition with resistant cells. This relies on the assumption that resistant cells have impaired cellular fitness. Here, using a model of resistance to a pharmacological cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKi), we show that this assumption is valid when competition between cells is spatially structured. We generate CDKi-resistant cancer cells and find that they have reduced proliferative fitness and stably rewired cell cycle control pathways. Low-dose CDKi outperforms high-dose CDKi in controlling tumour burden and resistance in tumour spheroids, but not in monolayer culture. Mathematical modelling indicates that tumour spatial structure amplifies the fitness penalty of resistant cells, and identifies their relative fitness as a critical determinant of the clinical benefit of AT. Our results justify further investigation of AT with kinase inhibitors.},

Unfortunately, all patients treated with these drugs will acquire resistance, most commonly as a result of a secondary mutation within EGFR (T790M). Because both drugs were developed to target wild-type EGFR, we hypothesized that current dosing schedules were not optimized for mutant EGFR or to prevent resistance. To investigate this further, we developed isogenic TKI-sensitive and TKI-resistant pairs of cell lines that mimic the behavior of human tumors. We determined that the drug-sensitive and drug-resistant EGFR-mutant cells exhibited differential growth kinetics, with the drug-resistant cells showing slower growth. We incorporated these data into evolutionary mathematical cancer models with constraints derived from clinical data sets. This modeling predicted alternative therapeutic strategies that could prolong the clinical benefit of TKIs against EGFR-mutant NSCLCs by delaying the development of resistance.},

@article{West2018b,
abstract = {A new ecologically inspired paradigm in cancer treatment known as "adaptive therapy" capitalizes on competitive interactions between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant subclones. The goal of adaptive therapy is to maintain a controllable stable tumor burden by allowing a significant population of treatment sensitive cells to survive which in turn suppress proliferation of the less fit resistant populations. This adaptive approach means that each patient's treatment is truly personalized based on the tumor's response rather than a one-size-fits-all fixed treatment regime. However, there remain several open challenges in designing adaptive therapies, particularly in extending these therapeutic concepts to multiple treatments. We present a simple extension of a previously developed model of metastatic prostate cancer to a frequency-dependent domain as a case study and point of departure to illustrate three novel concepts to aid the design of multi-drug adaptive therapies. First, frequency-dependent "cycles" of tumor evolution can trap tumor evolution in a periodic, controllable loop. Second, the availability and selection of treatments may limit the evolutionary "search space" reachable by the tumor. Third, the velocity of evolution is important to the timing of drug sequences. By noting that the stated goal of adaptive therapy is to maintain a stable tumor volume while controlling the tumor composition, we can make the simplifying assumption of a (relatively) constant tumor volume. We explain the importance of modeling frequency-dependent dynamics at play within a tumor, and show how these three concepts (evolutionary cycles, evolutionary search space, and evolutionary velocity) aid the selection of drugs and design of treatment schedules in multi-drug adaptive therapy.},

abstract = {In metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), abiraterone is conventionally administered continuously at maximal tolerated dose until treatment failure. The majority of patients initially respond well to abiraterone but the cancer cells evolve resistance and the cancer progresses within a median time of 16 months. Incorporating techniques that attempt to delay or prevent the growth of the resistant cancer cell phenotype responsible for disease progression have only recently entered the clinical setting. Here we use evolutionary game theory to model the evolutionary dynamics of patients with mCRPC subject to abiraterone therapy. In evaluating therapy options, we adopt an optimal control theory approach and seek the best treatment schedule using nonlinear constrained optimization. We compare patient outcomes from standard clinical treatments to those with other treatment objectives, such as maintaining a constant total tumor volume or minimizing the fraction of resistant cancer cells within the tumor. Our model predicts that continuous high doses of abiraterone as well as other therapies aimed at curing the patient result in accelerated competitive release of the resistant phenotype and rapid subsequent tumor progression. We find that long term control is achievable using optimized therapy through the restrained and judicious application of abiraterone, maintaining its effectiveness while providing acceptable patient quality of life. Implementing this strategy will require overcoming psychological and emotional barriers in patients and physicians as well as acquisition of a new class of clinical data designed to accurately estimate intratumoral eco-evolutionary dynamics during therapy.},

abstract = {Treatment of advanced cancers has benefited from new agents that supplement or bypass conventional therapies. However, even effective therapies fail as cancer cells deploy a wide range of resistance strategies. We propose that evolutionary dynamics ultimately determine survival and proliferation of resistant cells. Therefore, evolutionary strategies should be used with conventional therapies to delay or prevent resistance. Using an agent-based framework to model spatial competition among sensitive and resistant populations, we applied antiproliferative drug treatments to varying ratios of sensitive and resistant cells. We compared a continuous maximum-tolerated dose schedule with an adaptive schedule aimed at tumor control via competition between sensitive and resistant cells. Continuous treatment cured mostly sensitive tumors, but with any resistant cells, recurrence was inevitable. We identified two adaptive strategies that control heterogeneous tumors: dose modulation controls most tumors with less drug, while a more vacation-oriented schedule can control more invasive tumors. These findings offer potential modifications to treatment regimens that may improve outcomes and reduce resistance and recurrence.Significance: By using drug dose modulation or treatment vacations, adaptive therapy strategies control the emergence of tumor drug resistance by spatially suppressing less fit resistant populations in favor of treatment sensitive ones.

When applied to a dataset of 70 advanced colorectal cancers, our algorithm accurately predicts the sequence of APC, KRAS, and TP53 mutations previously defined by analyzing tumors at different stages of colon cancer formation. We further validate the method with glioblastoma and leukemia sample data and then apply it to complex integrated genomics databases, finding that high-level EGFR amplification appears to be a late event in primary glioblastomas.

However, these few driver alterations reside in a cancer genome alongside tens of thousands of additional mutations termed passengers. Passengers are widely believed to have no role in cancer, yet many passengers fall within protein-coding genes and other functional elements that can have potentially deleterious effects on cancer cells. Here we investigate the potential of moderately deleterious passengers to accumulate and alter the course of neoplastic progression. Our approach combines evolutionary simulations of cancer progression with an analysis of cancer sequencing data. From simulations, we find that passengers accumulate and largely evade natural selection during progression. Although individually weak, the collective burden of passengers alters the course of progression, leading to several oncological phenomena that are hard to explain with a traditional driver-centric view. We then tested the predictions of our model using cancer genomics data and confirmed that many passengers are likely damaging and have largely evaded negative selection. Finally, we use our model to explore cancer treatments that exploit the load of passengers by either (i) increasing the mutation rate or (ii) exacerbating their deleterious effects. Though both approaches lead to cancer regression, the latter is a more effective therapy. Our results suggest a unique framework for understanding cancer progression as a balance of driver and passenger mutations.},

However, cancer development is a slow process and, long before causing the death of the individual, may weaken organisms' capacities and impair their interactions with other species. Yet, the impact of cancer development on biotic interactions, and over the dynamics of the whole ecosystem, is still largely unexplored. As well, the feedback of altered biotic interactions on the evolution of resistance against cancer in the context of community ecology has not been investigated. From this new perspective, we theoretically investigate how cancer can challenge expected interactions outcomes in a predator-prey model system, and how in return, these altered interactions outcomes could affect evolution of resistance mechanism against cancer. First, we demonstrate a clear difference between prey and predator vulnerability to cancer, with cancer having limited impact on prey populations. Second, we show that biotic interactions can surprisingly lead to a null or positive effect of cancer on population densities. Finally, our evolutionary analysis shed light on how biotic interactions can lead to diverse resistance levels in predator populations. While its role in ecosystems is mostly unknown, we demonstrate that cancer in wildlife is an important ecological and evolutionary force to consider.},

By mapping the accumulation of driver mutations into a graph theoretical problem, we show that in leading order of the mutation rate the probability of collecting a given number of driver mutations depends only on the distribution of the lineage lengths (irrespective of any other details of the cell lineage tree), and we derive a simple analytical formula for this probability. Our results are crucial in understanding how natural selection can shape the cell lineage trees of multicellular organisms in order to reduce their lifetime risk of cancer. In particular, our results highlight the significance of the longest cell lineages. Our analytical formula also provides a tool to quantify cancer susceptibility in theoretical models of tissue development and maintenance, as well as for empirical data on cell linage trees.},

abstract = {A comparison between the evolution of cancer cell populations and RNA viruses reveals a number of remarkable similarities. Both display high levels of plasticity and adaptability as a consequence of high degrees of genetic variation. It has been suggested that, as it occurs with RNA viruses, there is a threshold in the levels of genetic instability affordable by cancer cells in order to be able to overcome selection barriers (Trends Genet. 15 (1999) M57). Here we explore this concept by means of a simple mathematical model. It is shown that an error threshold exists in this model, which investigates both competition between cancer cell populations and its impact on overall tumor growth dynamics. Once the threshold is reached, the highly unstable tumor cell populations, which were sustaining malignant growth, become unable to maintain their genetic information, which in turn triggers a slowed down overall tumor growth regime. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Unfortunately, all patients treated with these drugs will acquire resistance, most commonly as a result of a secondary mutation within EGFR (T790M). Because both drugs were developed to target wild-type EGFR, we hypothesized that current dosing schedules were not optimized for mutant EGFR or to prevent resistance. To investigate this further, we developed isogenic TKI-sensitive and TKI-resistant pairs of cell lines that mimic the behavior of human tumors. We determined that the drug-sensitive and drug-resistant EGFR-mutant cells exhibited differential growth kinetics, with the drug-resistant cells showing slower growth. We incorporated these data into evolutionary mathematical cancer models with constraints derived from clinical data sets. This modeling predicted alternative therapeutic strategies that could prolong the clinical benefit of TKIs against EGFR-mutant NSCLCs by delaying the development of resistance.},

abstract = {In metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), abiraterone is conventionally administered continuously at maximal tolerated dose until treatment failure. The majority of patients initially respond well to abiraterone but the cancer cells evolve resistance and the cancer progresses within a median time of 16 months. Incorporating techniques that attempt to delay or prevent the growth of the resistant cancer cell phenotype responsible for disease progression have only recently entered the clinical setting. Here we use evolutionary game theory to model the evolutionary dynamics of patients with mCRPC subject to abiraterone therapy. In evaluating therapy options, we adopt an optimal control theory approach and seek the best treatment schedule using nonlinear constrained optimization. We compare patient outcomes from standard clinical treatments to those with other treatment objectives, such as maintaining a constant total tumor volume or minimizing the fraction of resistant cancer cells within the tumor. Our model predicts that continuous high doses of abiraterone as well as other therapies aimed at curing the patient result in accelerated competitive release of the resistant phenotype and rapid subsequent tumor progression. We find that long term control is achievable using optimized therapy through the restrained and judicious application of abiraterone, maintaining its effectiveness while providing acceptable patient quality of life. Implementing this strategy will require overcoming psychological and emotional barriers in patients and physicians as well as acquisition of a new class of clinical data designed to accurately estimate intratumoral eco-evolutionary dynamics during therapy.},

abstract = {A tumor is made up of a heterogeneous collection of cell types all competing on a fitness landscape mediated by micro-environmental conditions that dictate their interactions. Despite the fact that much is known about cell signaling and cellular cooperation, the specifics of how the cell-to-cell coupling and the range over which this coupling acts affect the macroscopic tumor growth laws that govern total volume, mass, and carrying capacity remain poorly understood. We develop a statistical mechanics approach that focuses on the total number of possible states each cell can occupy, and show how different assumptions on correlations of these states gives rise to the many different macroscopic tumor growth laws used in the literature. Although it is widely understood that molecular and cellular heterogeneity within a tumor is a driver of growth, here we emphasize that focusing on the functional coupling of these states at the cellular level is what determines macroscopic growth characteristics. Significance statement A mathematical model relating tumor heterogeneity at the cellular level to tumor growth at the macroscopic level is described based on a statistical mechanics framework. The model takes into account the number of accessible states available to each cell as well as their long-range coupling (population cooperation) to other cells. We show that the degree to which cell populations cooperate determine the number of independent cell states, which in turn dictates the macroscopic (volumetric) growth law. It follows that targeting cell-to-cell interactions could be a way of mitigating and controlling tumor growth.},

abstract = {The Gompertz model is well known and widely used in many aspects of biology. It has been frequently used to describe the growth of animals and plants, as well as the number or volume of bacteria and cancer cells. Numerous parametrisations and re-parametrisations of varying usefulness are found in the literature, whereof the Gompertz-Laird is one of the more commonly used. Here, we review, present, and discuss the many re-parametrisations and some parameterisations of the Gompertz model, which we divide into Ti (type I)- and W0 (type II)-forms. In the W0-form a starting-point parameter, meaning birth or hatching value (W0), replaces the inflection-time parameter (Ti). We also propose new "unified" versions (U-versions) of both the traditional Ti -form and a simplified W0-form. In these, the growth-rate constant represents the relative growth rate instead of merely an unspecified growth coefficient. We also present U-versions where the growth-rate parameters return absolute growth rate (instead of relative). The new U-Gompertz models are special cases of the Unified-Richards (U-Richards) model and thus belong to the Richards family of U-models. As U-models, they have a set of parameters, which are comparable across models in the family, without conversion equations. The improvements are simple, and may seem trivial, but are of great importance to those who study organismal growth, as the two new U-Gompertz forms give easy and fast access to all shape parameters needed for describing most types of growth following the shape of the Gompertz model.},

abstract = {Gene duplication is thought to be a major source of evolutionary innovation because it allows one copy of a gene to mutate and explore genetic space while the other copy continues to fulfill the original function. Models of the process often implicitly assume that a single mutation to the duplicated gene can confer a new selectable property. Yet some protein features, such as disulfide bonds or ligand binding sites, require the participation of two or more amino acid residues, which could require several mutations. Here we model the evolution of such protein features by what we consider to be the conceptually simplest route-point mutation in duplicated genes. We show that for very large population sizes N, where at steady state in the absence of selection the population would be expected to contain one or more duplicated alleles coding for the feature, the time to fixation in the population hovers near the inverse of the point mutation rate, and varies sluggishly with the lambda(th) root of 1/N, where lambda is the number of nucleotide positions that must be mutated to produce the feature. At smaller population sizes, the time to fixation varies linearly with 1/N and exceeds the inverse of the point mutation rate. We conclude that, in general, to be fixed in 10(8) generations, the production of novel protein features that require the participation of two or more amino acid residues simply by multiple point mutations in duplicated genes would entail population sizes of no less than 10(9).},

Fragmentation modes in nature range from binary fission in bacteria to collective-level fragmentation and the production of unicellular propagules in multicellular organisms. Despite this apparent ubiquity, the adaptive significance of fragmentation modes has received little attention. Here, we develop a model in which groups arise from the division of single cells that do not separate but stay together until the moment of group fragmentation. We allow for all possible fragmentation patterns and calculate the population growth rate of each associated life cycle. Fragmentation modes that maximise growth rate comprise a restrictive set of patterns that include production of unicellular propagules and division into two similar size groups. Life cycles marked by single-cell bottlenecks maximise population growth rate under a wide range of conditions. This surprising result offers a new evolutionary explanation for the widespread occurrence of this mode of reproduction. All in all, our model provides a framework for exploring the adaptive significance of fragmentation modes and their associated life cycles.},

This method does not assume that the sequence of driver alterations is the same for each tumor, but enables the degree of similarity or difference in the sequence to be evaluated. RESULTS: To evaluate the new method, we applied it to colon cancer tumor sequencing data and the results are consistent with the multi-step tumorigenesis model previously developed based on comparing stages of cancer. We then applied the new method to DNA sequencing data for a set of lung cancers. The model may be a useful tool for better understanding the process of tumorigenesis.

@article{Strobl2020c,
abstract = {1 Abstract "Control and conquer"-this is the philosophy behind adaptive therapy (AT), which seeks to exploit intra-tumoral competition to avoid, or at least, delay the emergence of therapy resistance in cancer. Motivated by promising results from theoretical, experimental and, most recently, clinical studies, there is an increasing interest in extending this approach to other cancers. As such, it is urgent to understand the characteristics of a cancer which determine whether it will respond well to AT, or not. A plausible candidate for such a selection criterion is the fitness cost of resistance. In this paper, we study a 2-population ordinary differential equation (ODE) model to investigate whether the presence of a cost is a necessary condition for AT to extend the time to progression beyond that of a standard-of-care continuous therapy. We find that for tumours close to their environmental carrying capacity such a cost of resistance is not required. However, for tumours growing far from carrying capacity a cost may be required to see meaningful gains. Notably, we show that in such cases it is important to consider the cell turnover in the tumour and we discuss its role in modulating the impact of a cost of resistance. Overall, our work helps to clarify under which circumstances AT may be beneficial, and suggests that turnover may play an unexpectedly important role in the decision making process.},

abstract = {Tumor growth curves are classically modeled by means of ordinary differential equations. In analyzing the Gompertz model several studies have reported a striking correlation between the two parameters of the model, which could be used to reduce the dimensionality and improve predictive power. We analyzed tumor growth kinetics within the statistical framework of nonlinear mixed-effects (population approach). This allowed the simultaneous modeling of tumor dynamics and inter-animal variability. Experimental data comprised three animal models of breast and lung cancers, with 833 measurements in 94 animals. Candidate models of tumor growth included the exponential, logistic and Gompertz models. The exponential and—more notably—logistic models failed to describe the experimental data whereas the Gompertz model generated very good fits. The previously reported population-level correlation between the Gompertz parameters was further confirmed in our analysis (R2{\textgreater} 0.92 in all groups). Combining this structural correlation with rigorous population parameter estimation, we propose a reduced Gompertz function consisting of a single individual parameter (and one population parameter). Leveraging the population approach using Bayesian inference, we estimated times of tumor initiation using three late measurement timepoints. The reduced Gompertz model was found to exhibit the best results, with drastic improvements when using Bayesian inference as compared to likelihood maximization alone, for both accuracy and precision. Specifically, mean accuracy (prediction error) was 12.2{\%} versus 78{\%} and mean precision (width of the 95{\%} prediction interval) was 15.6 days versus 210 days, for the breast cancer cell line. These results demonstrate the superior predictive power of the reduced Gompertz model, especially when combined with Bayesian estimation. They offer possible clinical perspectives for personalized prediction of the age of a tumor from limited data at diagnosis. The code and data used in our analysis are publicly available at https://github.com/cristinavaghi/plumky.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Carcinogenesis affects not only humans but almost all metazoan species. Understanding the rules driving the occurrence of cancers in the wild is currently expected to provide crucial insights into identifying how some species may have evolved efficient cancer resistance mechanisms. Recently the absence of correlation across species between cancer prevalence and body size (coined as Peto's paradox) has attracted a lot of attention. Indeed, the disparity between this null hypothesis, where every cell is assumed to have an identical probability to undergo malignant transformation, and empirical observations is particularly important to understand, due to the fact that it could facilitate the identification of animal species that are more resistant to carcinogenesis than expected. Moreover it would open up ways to identify the selective pressures that may be involved in cancer resistance. However, Peto's paradox relies on several questionable assumptions, complicating the interpretation of the divergence between expected and observed cancer incidences.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDISCUSSIONS: Here we review and challenge the different hypotheses on which this paradox relies on with the aim of identifying how this null hypothesis could be better estimated in order to provide a standard protocol to study the deviation between theoretical/theoretically predicted and observed cancer incidence. We show that due to the disproportion and restricted nature of available data on animal cancers, applying Peto's hypotheses at species level could result in erroneous conclusions, and actually assume the existence of a paradox. Instead of using species level comparisons, we propose an organ level approach to be a more accurate test of Peto's assumptions. The accuracy of Peto's paradox assumptions are rarely valid and/or quantifiable, suggesting the need to reconsider the use of Peto's paradox as a null hypothesis in identifying the influence of natural selection on cancer resistance mechanisms.},

abstract = {Cancer evolves through the accumulation of mutations, but the order in which mutations occur is poorly understood. Inference of a temporal ordering on the level of genes is challenging because clinically and histologically identical tumors often have few mutated genes in common. This heterogeneity may at least in part be due to mutations in different genes having similar phenotypic effects by acting in the same functional pathway. We estimate the constraints on the order in which alterations accumulate during cancer progression from cross-sectional mutation data using a probabilistic graphical model termed Hidden Conjunctive Bayesian Network (H-CBN). The possible orders are analyzed on the level of genes and, after mapping genes to functional pathways, also on the pathway level. We find stronger evidence for pathway order constraints than for gene order constraints, indicating that temporal ordering results from selective pressure acting at the pathway level. The accumulation of changes in core pathways differs among cancer types, yet a common feature is that progression appears to begin with mutations in genes that regulate apoptosis pathways and to conclude with mutations in genes involved in invasion pathways. H-CBN models provide a quantitative and intuitive model of tumorigenesis showing that the genetic events can be linked to the phenotypic progression on the level of pathways.},

@article{Laird1964,
abstract = {IT is commonly believed that tumor growth under ideal conditions is a simple exponential process terminated by the exhaustion of the nutritional support provided by the host. However, a survey of the literature shows that exponential growth of tumors has been observed only rarely and then only for relatively brief periods. When we consider those tumors whose growth has been followed over a sufficiently extensive range (100 to 1000-fold range ofgrowth or more), we find that nearly all such tumors grow more and more slowly as the tumor gets larger, with no appreciable period ofgrowth at a constant specific growth rate as would be expected for simple exponential growth. This continuous deceleration of growth has the consequence in many cases that the diameter (if a solid tumor) or the cube root of total cell number (if an ascites tumor) when plotted against time gives a close approximation to a straight line (Mayneord, 1932; Schrek, 1935; Klein and Revesz, 1953; Patt and Blackford, 1954). Mayneord (1932) has shown that cube root growth could be readily explained in mathematical terms if the active growth of a solid tumor were limited to a thin layer of cells at the surface of the tumor. However, in practice most solid tumors do not grow only at the surface, and in the case of ascites tumors it has been possible to Jabel the DNA of nearly 100 per cent of the tumor cells (Baserga, Kisieleski, and Halvorsen, 1960), indicating that almost all of these cells are viable and proliferating. Hence, although cube root growth has been empirically established for many tumors, it is difficult to relate it mathe- matically to proliferation of tumor cells. The present study offers a model of tumor cell proliferation that would account for the observed course of tumor growth. Furthermore, it will be shown that there is a distinct difference between the continuous and regular slowing characteristic of tumor growth and the more abrupt cessation of exponential growth observed when bacterial cultures outgrow their nutrient supply. Finally, implications of this new interpretation of tumor growth will be discussed in relation to concepts of host- tumor interaction.},

Here, we develop and implement more than 88,000 instances of a stochastic evolutionary model simulating genetic drift and neoplastic progression. Under different combinations of population genetic parameter values, including those estimated for colorectal cancer and glioblastoma multiforme, the distribution of sizes of subclones carrying driver mutations had a heavy right tail at the time of tumor detection, with only 1 to 4 dominant clones present at ≥10{\%} frequency. In contrast, the vast majority of subclones were present at {\textless}10{\%} frequency, many of which had higher fitness than currently dominant clones. The number of dominant clones (≥10{\%} frequency) in a tumor correlated strongly with the number of subclones ({\textless}10{\%} of the tumor). Overall, these subclones were frequently below current standard detection thresholds, frequently harbored treatment-resistant mutations, and were more common in slow-growing tumors.Significance: The model presented in this paper addresses tumor heterogeneity by framing expectations for the number of resistant subclones in a tumor, with implications for future studies of the evolution of therapeutic resistance.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Ghaffarizadeh et al. Many multicellular systems problems can only be understood by studying how cells move, grow, divide, interact, and die. Tissue-scale dynamics emerge from systems of many interacting cells as they respond to and influence their microenvironment. The ideal “virtual laboratory” for such multicellular systems simulates both the biochemical microenvironment (the “stage”) and many mechanically and biochemically interacting cells (the “players” upon the stage). PhysiCell—physics-based multicellular simulator—is an open source agent-based simulator that provides both the stage and the players for studying many interacting cells in dynamic tissue microenvironments. It builds upon a multi-substrate biotransport solver to link cell phenotype to multiple diffusing substrates and signaling factors. It includes biologically-driven sub-models for cell cycling, apoptosis, necrosis, solid and fluid volume changes, mechanics, and motility “out of the box.” The C++ code has minimal dependencies, making it simple to maintain and deploy across platforms. PhysiCell has been parallelized with OpenMP, and its performance scales linearly with the number of cells. Simulations up to 105-106cells are feasible on quad-core desktop workstations; larger simulations are attainable on single HPC compute nodes. We demonstrate PhysiCell by simulating the impact of necrotic core biomechanics, 3-D geometry, and stochasticity on the dynamics of hanging drop tumor spheroids and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast. We demonstrate stochastic motility, chemical and contact-based interaction of multiple cell types, and the extensibility of PhysiCell with examples in synthetic multicellular systems (a “cellular cargo delivery” system, with application to anti-cancer treatments), cancer heterogeneity, and cancer immunology. PhysiCell is a powerful multicellular systems simulator that will be continually improved with new capabilities and performance improvements. It also represents a significant independent code base for replicating results from other simulation platforms. The PhysiCell source code, examples, documentation, and support are available under the BSD license at http://PhysiCell.MathCancer.org and http://PhysiCell.sf.net.},

Recent high-throughput genomic studies of cancer cells have shown that the mutational landscape of cancer is complex and that individual cancers may evolve through mutations in as many as 20 different cancer-associated genes. We use data published by Sj{\"{o}}blom et al. (2006) to develop a new mathematical model for the somatic evolution of colorectal cancers. We employ the Wright-Fisher process for exploring the basic parameters of this evolutionary process and derive an analytical approximation for the expected waiting time to the cancer phenotype. Our results highlight the relative importance of selection over both the size of the cell population at risk and the mutation rate. The model predicts that the observed genetic diversity of cancer genomes can arise under a normal mutation rate if the average selective advantage per mutation is on the order of 1{\%}. Increased mutation rates due to genetic instability would allow even smaller selective advantages during tumorigenesis. The complexity of cancer progression can be understood as the result of multiple sequential mutations, each of which has a relatively small but positive effect on net cell growth.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cancer incidence and mortality increase with age through much of adulthood, but earlier work has found that these rates decline among the very elderly. To compare incidence and mortality at the oldest ages, the authors investigated both in the same large population, which comprised 9.5{\%} of the United States in 2000. The authors also report age-specific prevalence among the elderly, which has received little attention. METHODS: Twenty-three cancer types were studied in men, and 24 cancer types were studied in women. Patient records were obtained from the SEER 9 cancer registries, and population figures were taken from the 2000 US Census. The authors explored the reliability of census data on the oldest old, which has been questioned. RESULTS: Age-specific incidence, prevalence, and mortality results are presented for the years 1998 to 2002. Incidence and mortality usually decreased or plateaued at very old ages. Prevalence usually decreased swiftly at ages {\textgreater}90 years. When there was statistical power, incidence normally peaked between ages 75 years and 90 years, dropping abruptly afterward. With several large exceptions, peak incidence and mortality coincided within ±5 years. Both rates often trended toward zero among centenarians, who may be asymptomatic or insusceptible. CONCLUSIONS: The current results were found to be consistent with autopsy and survival studies. Most age-specific models of carcinogenesis are based on cancer rate data for ages {\textless}85 years. The authors argue that these models could not fit the current results without fundamental modification and outline biologic mechanisms for such modification, mostly cellular and tissue senescence. They also recommend caution to researchers who use census data on the very elderly. Cancer 2012;. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Cancer Society.},

Different mutational processes may contribute to the mutations accumulated in a cell, with each imprinting a mutational signature on the cell's genome. Some processes generate mutations throughout life at a constant rate in all individuals, and the number of mutations in a cell attributable to these processes will be proportional to the chronological age of the person. Using mutations from 10,250 cancer genomes across 36 cancer types, we investigated clock-like mutational processes that have been operating in normal human cells. Two mutational signatures show clock-like properties. Both exhibit different mutation rates in different tissues. However, their mutation rates are not correlated, indicating that the underlying processes are subject to different biological influences. For one signature, the rate of cell division may influence its mutation rate. This study provides the first survey of clock-like mutational processes operating in human somatic cells.},

abstract = {We investigate the dynamics of cancer initiation in a mathematical model with one driver mutation and several passenger mutations. Our analysis is based on a multi-type branching process: we model individual cells which can either divide or undergo apoptosis. In the case of a cell division, the two daughter cells can mutate, which potentially confers a change in fitness to the cell. In contrast to previous models, the change in fitness induced by the driver mutation depends on the genetic context of the cell, in our case on the number of passenger mutations. The passenger mutations themselves have no or only a very small impact on the cell[U+05F3]s fitness. While our model is not designed as a specific model for a particular cancer, the underlying idea is motivated by clinical and experimental observations in Burkitt Lymphoma. In this tumor, the hallmark mutation leads to deregulation of the MYC oncogene which increases the rate of apoptosis, but also the proliferation rate of cells. This increase in the rate of apoptosis hence needs to be overcome by mutations affecting apoptotic pathways, naturally leading to an epistatic fitness landscape. This model shows a very interesting dynamical behavior which is distinct from the dynamics of cancer initiation in the absence of epistasis. Since the driver mutation is deleterious to a cell with only a few passenger mutations, there is a period of stasis in the number of cells until a clone of cells with enough passenger mutations emerges. Only when the driver mutation occurs in one of those cells, the cell population starts to grow rapidly. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The canonical route from normal tissue to cancer occurs through sequential acquisition of somatic mutations. Many studies have constructed a linear genetic model for tumorigenesis using the genetic alterations associated with samples at different stages of neoplastic progression from cross-sectional data. The common interpretation of these models is that they reflect the temporal order within any given tumor. Linear genetic methods implicitly neglect genetic heterogeneity within a neoplasm; each neoplasm is assumed to consist of one dominant clone. We modeled neoplastic progression of colorectal cancer using an agent-based model of a colon crypt and found clonal heterogeneity within our simulated neoplasms, as observed in vivo. Just 7.3{\%} of cells within neoplasms acquired mutations in the same order as the linear model. In 41{\%} of the simulated neoplasms, no cells acquired mutations in the same order as the linear model. We obtained similarly poor results when comparing the temporal order with oncogenetic tree models inferred from cross-sectional data. However, when we reconstructed the cell lineage of mutations within a neoplasm using several biopsies, we found that 99.7{\%} cells within neoplasms acquired their mutations in an order consistent with the cell lineage mutational order. Thus, we find that using cross-sectional data to infer mutational order is misleading, whereas phylogenetic methods based on sampling intratumor heterogeneity accurately reconstructs the evolutionary history of tumors. In addition, we find evidence that disruption of differentiation is likely the first lesion in progression for most cancers and should be one of the few regularities of neoplastic progression across cancers.},

abstract = {Recent advances have enabled powerful methods to sort tumors into prognosis and treatment groups. We are still missing, however, a general theoretical framework to understand the vast diversity of tumor gene expression and mutations. Here we present a framework based on multi-task evolution theory, using the fact that tumors need to perform multiple tasks that contribute to their fitness. We find that trade-offs between tasks constrain tumor gene-expression to a continuum bounded by a polyhedron whose vertices are gene-expression profiles, each specializing in one task. We find five universal cancer tasks across tissue-types: cell-division, biomass and energy, lipogenesis, immune-interaction and invasion and tissue-remodeling. Tumors that specialize in a task are sensitive to drugs that interfere with this task. Driver, but not passenger, mutations tune gene-expression towards specialization in specific tasks. This approach can integrate additional types of molecular data into a framework of tumor diversity grounded in evolutionary theory.},

abstract = {Cancer arises through a multistage process, but it is not fully clear how this process influences the age-specific incidence curve. Studies of colorectal and pancreatic cancer using the multistage clonal expansion (MSCE) model have identified two phases of the incidence curves. One phase is linear, beginning about age of 60 years, suggesting that at least two rare rate-limiting mutations occur before clonal expansion of premalignant cells. A second phase is exponential, seen in early-onset cancers occurring before the age of 60 years that are associated with premalignant clonal expansion. Here, we extend the MSCE model to include clonal expansion of malignant cells, an advance that permits study of the effects of tumor growth and extinction on the incidence of colorectal, gastric, pancreatic, and esophageal adenocarcinomas in the digestive tract. After adjusting the age-specific incidence for birth-cohort and calendar-year trends, we found that initiating mutations and premalignant cell kinetics can explain the primary features of the incidence curve. However, we also found that the incidence data of these cancers harbored information on the kinetics of malignant clonal expansion before clinical detection, including tumor growth rates and extinction probabilities on three characteristic time scales for tumor progression. In addition, the data harbored information on the mean sojourn times for premalignant clones until occurrence of either the first malignant cell or the first persistent (surviving) malignant clone. Finally, the data also harbored information on the mean sojourn time of persistent malignant clones to the time of diagnosis. In conclusion, cancer incidence curves can harbor significant information about hidden processes of tumor initiation, premalignant clonal expansion, and malignant transformation, and even some limited information on tumor growth before clinical detection.},

abstract = {Natural selection can favour health at youth or middle age (high reproductive value) over health at old age (low reproductive value). This means, all else being equal, selection for cancer suppression should dramatically drop after reproductive age. However, in species with significant parental investment, the capacity to enhance inclusive fitness may increase the reproductive value of older individuals or even those past reproductive age. Variation in parental investment levels could therefore contribute to variation in cancer susceptibility across species. In this article, we describe a simple model and framework for the evolution of cancer suppression with varying levels of parental investment and use this model to make testable predictions about variation in cancer suppression across species. This model can be extended to show that selection for cancer suppression is stronger in species with cooperative breeding systems and intergenerational transfers. We consider three cases that can select for cancer suppression into old age: (i) extended parental care that increases the survivorship of their offspring, (ii) grandparents contributing to higher fecundity of their children and (iii) cooperative breeding where helpers forgo reproduction or even survivorship to assist parents in having higher fecundity.},

abstract = {The intrinsic risk of cancer increases with body size and longevity; however, big long-lived species do not exhibit this increase, a contradiction named Peto's paradox. Five hypotheses potentially resolving this paradox were modeled using the multistage model of carcinogenesis. The five hypotheses were based on (1) intrinsic changes in metabolic rate with body size; adaptive increase in immune policing of (2) cancer cells or (3) cells with driver mutations; or adaptive increase in cancer suppression via (4) decreased somatic mutation rate, or (5) increased genetic control. Parameter changes needed to stabilize cancer risk in three types of cancer were estimated for tissues scaled from mouse size and longevity to human and blue whale levels. The metabolic rate hypothesis alone was rejected due to a conflict between the required interspecific effect with the observed intraspecific effect of size on cancer risk, but some metabolic change was optionally incorporated in the other models. Necessary parameter changes in immune policing and somatic mutation rate far exceeded values observed; however, natural selection increasing the genetic suppression of cancer was generally consistent with data. Such adaptive increases in genetic control of cancers in large and/or long-lived animals raise the possibility that nonmodel animals will reveal novel anticancer mechanisms.},

@article{Strobl2020b,
abstract = {Invasion of healthy tissue is a defining feature of malignant tumours. Traditionally, invasion is thought to be driven by cells that have acquired all the necessary traits to overcome the range of biological and physical defences employed by the body. However, in light of the ever-increasing evidence for geno- and phenotypic intra-tumour heterogeneity, an alternative hypothesis presents itself: could invasion be driven by a collection of cells with distinct traits that together facilitate the invasion process? In this paper, we use a mathematical model to assess the feasibility of this hypothesis in the context of acid-mediated invasion. We assume tumour expansion is obstructed by stroma which inhibits growth and extra-cellular matrix (ECM) which blocks cancer cell movement. Further, we assume that there are two types of cancer cells: (i) a glycolytic phenotype which produces acid that kills stromal cells and (ii) a matrix-degrading phenotype that locally remodels the ECM. We extend the Gatenby–Gawlinski reaction–diffusion model to derive a system of five coupled reaction–diffusion equations to describe the resulting invasion process. We characterise the spatially homogeneous steady states and carry out a simulation study in one spatial dimension to determine how the tumour develops as we vary the strength of competition between the two phenotypes. We find that overall tumour growth is most extensive when both cell types can stably coexist, since this allows the cells to locally mix and benefit most from the combination of traits. In contrast, when inter-species competition exceeds intra-species competition the populations spatially separate and invasion arrests either: (i) rapidly (matrix-degraders dominate) or (ii) slowly (acid-producers dominate). Overall, our work demonstrates that the spatial and ecological relationship between a heterogeneous population of tumour cells is a key factor in determining their ability to cooperate. Specifically, we predict that tumours in which different phenotypes coexist stably are more invasive than tumours in which phenotypes are spatially separated.},

@article{Jain2011,
abstract = {Prostate cancer progression depends in part on the complex interactions between testosterone, its active metabolite DHT, and androgen receptors. In a metastatic setting, the first line of treatment is the elimination of testosterone. However, such interventions are not curative because cancer cells evolve via multiple mechanisms to a castrate-resistant state, allowing progression to a lethal outcome. It is hypothesized that administration of antiandrogen therapy in an intermittent, as opposed to continuous, manner may bestow improved disease control with fewer treatment-related toxicities. The present study develops a biochemically motivated mathematical model of antiandrogen therapy that can be tested prospectively as a predictive tool. The model includes "personalized" parameters, which address the heterogeneity in the predicted course of the disease under various androgen-deprivation schedules. Model simulations are able to capture a variety of clinically observed outcomes for "average" patient data under different intermittent schedules. The model predicts that in the absence of a competitive advantage of androgen-dependent cancer cells over castration-resistant cancer cells, intermittent scheduling can lead to more rapid treatment failure as compared to continuous treatment. However, increasing a competitive advantage for hormone-sensitive cells swings the balance in favor of intermittent scheduling, delaying the acquisition of genetic or epigenetic alterations empowering androgen resistance. Given the near universal prevalence of antiandrogen treatment failure in the absence of competing mortality, such modeling has the potential of developing into a useful tool for incorporation into clinical research trials and ultimately as a prognostic tool for individual patients.},

abstract = {Tumors are appreciated to be an intrinsically heterogeneous population of cells with varying proliferation capacities and tumorigenic potentials. As a central tenet of the so-called cancer stem cell hypothesis, most cancer cells have only a limited lifespan, and thus cannot initiate or reinitiate tumors. Longevity and clonogenicity are properties unique to the subpopulation of cancer stem cells. To understand the implications of the population structure suggested by this hypothesis--a hierarchy consisting of cancer stem cells and progeny non-stem cancer cells which experience a reduction in their remaining proliferation capacity per division--we set out to develop a mathematical model for the development of the aggregate population. We show that overall tumor progression rate during the exponential growth phase is identical to the growth rate of the cancer stem cell compartment. Tumors with identical stem cell proportions, however, can have different growth rates, dependent on the proliferation kinetics of all participating cell populations. Analysis of the model revealed that the proliferation potential of non-stem cancer cells is likely to be small to reproduce biologic observations. Furthermore, a single compartment of non-stem cancer cell population may adequately represent population growth dynamics only when the compartment proliferation rate is scaled with the generational hierarchy depth.},

abstract = {Treatment of advanced cancers has benefited from new agents that supplement or bypass conventional therapies. However, even effective therapies fail as cancer cells deploy a wide range of resistance strategies. We propose that evolutionary dynamics ultimately determine survival and proliferation of resistant cells. Therefore, evolutionary strategies should be used with conventional therapies to delay or prevent resistance. Using an agent-based framework to model spatial competition among sensitive and resistant populations, we applied antiproliferative drug treatments to varying ratios of sensitive and resistant cells. We compared a continuous maximum-tolerated dose schedule with an adaptive schedule aimed at tumor control via competition between sensitive and resistant cells. Continuous treatment cured mostly sensitive tumors, but with any resistant cells, recurrence was inevitable. We identified two adaptive strategies that control heterogeneous tumors: dose modulation controls most tumors with less drug, while a more vacation-oriented schedule can control more invasive tumors. These findings offer potential modifications to treatment regimens that may improve outcomes and reduce resistance and recurrence.Significance: By using drug dose modulation or treatment vacations, adaptive therapy strategies control the emergence of tumor drug resistance by spatially suppressing less fit resistant populations in favor of treatment sensitive ones.

abstract = {Cancer biology involves complex, dynamic interactions between cancer cells and their tissue microenvironments. Single-cell effects are critical drivers of clinical progression. Chemical and mechanical communication between tumor and stromal cells can co-opt normal physiologic processes to promote growth and invasion. Cancer cell heterogeneity increases cancer's ability to test strategies to adapt to microenvironmental stresses. Hypoxia and treatment can select for cancer stem cells and drive invasion and resistance. Cell-based computational models (also known as discrete models, agent-based models, or individual-based models) simulate individual cells as they interact in virtual tissues, which allows us to explore how single-cell behaviors lead to the dynamics we observe and work to control in cancer systems. In this review, we introduce the broad range of techniques available for cell-based computational modeling. The approaches can range from highly detailed models of just a few cells and their morphologies to millions of simpler cells in three-dimensional tissues. Modeling individual cells allows us to directly translate biologic observations into simulation rules. In many cases, individual cell agents include molecular-scale models. Most models also simulate the transport of oxygen, drugs, and growth factors, which allow us to link cancer development to microenvironmental conditions. We illustrate these methods with examples drawn from cancer hypoxia, angiogenesis, invasion, stem cells, and immunosurveillance. An ecosystem of interoperable cell-based simulation tools is emerging at a time when cloud computing resources make software easier to access and supercomputing resources make large-scale simulation studies possible. As the field develops, we anticipate that high-throughput simulation studies will allow us to rapidly explore the space of biologic possibilities, prescreen new therapeutic strategies, and even re-engineer tumor and stromal cells to bring cancer systems under control.},

We generate CDKi-resistant cancer cells and find that they have reduced proliferative fitness and stably rewired cell cycle control pathways. Low-dose CDKi outperforms high-dose CDKi in controlling tumour burden and resistance in tumour spheroids, but not in monolayer culture. Mathematical modelling indicates that tumour spatial structure amplifies the fitness penalty of resistant cells, and identifies their relative fitness as a critical determinant of the clinical benefit of AT. Our results justify further investigation of AT with kinase inhibitors.},

abstract = {Combination therapies have shown remarkable success in preventing the evolution of resistance to multiple drugs, including HIV, tuberculosis, and cancer. Nevertheless, the rise in drug resistance still remains an important challenge. The capability to accurately predict the emergence of resistance, either to one or multiple drugs, may help to improve treatment options. Existing theoretical approaches often focus on exponential growth laws, which may not be realistic when scarce resources and competition limit growth. In this work, we study the emergence of single and double drug resistance in a model of combination therapy of two drugs. The model describes a sensitive strain, two types of single-resistant strains, and a double-resistant strain. We compare the probability that resistance emerges for three growth laws: exponential growth, logistic growth without competition between strains, and logistic growth with competition between strains. Using mathematical estimates and numerical simulations, we show that between-strain competition only affects the emergence of single resistance when resources are scarce. In contrast, the probability of double resistance is affected by between-strain competition over a wider space of resource availability. This indicates that competition between different resistant strains may be pertinent to identifying strategies for suppressing drug resistance, and that exponential models may overestimate the emergence of resistance to multiple drugs. A by-product of our work is an efficient strategy to evaluate probabilities of single and double resistance in models with multiple sequential mutations. This may be useful for a range of other problems in which the probability of resistance is of interest.},

We investigated pancreatic cancer progression by utilizing a mathematical framework of metastasis formation together with comprehensive data of 228 patients, 101 of whom had autopsies. We found that pancreatic cancer growth is initially exponential. After estimating the rates of pancreatic cancer growth and dissemination, we determined that patients likely harbor metastases at diagnosis and predicted the number and size distribution of metastases as well as patient survival. These findings were validated in an independent database. Finally, we analyzed the effects of different treatment modalities, finding that therapies that efficiently reduce the growth rate of cells earlier in the course of treatment appear to be superior to upfront tumor resection. These predictions can be validated in the clinic. Our interdisciplinary approach provides insights into the dynamics of pancreatic cancer metastasis and identifies optimum therapeutic interventions. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Summary
Intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH) is a mechanism of therapeutic resistance and therefore an important clinical challenge. However, the extent, origin, and drivers of ITH across cancer types are poorly understood. To address this, we extensively characterize ITH across whole-genome sequences of 2,658 cancer samples spanning 38 cancer types. Nearly all informative samples (95.1{\%}) contain evidence of distinct subclonal expansions with frequent branching relationships between subclones. We observe positive selection of subclonal driver mutations across most cancer types and identify cancer type-specific subclonal patterns of driver gene mutations, fusions, structural variants, and copy number alterations as well as dynamic changes in mutational processes between subclonal expansions. Our results underline the importance of ITH and its drivers in tumor evolution and provide a pan-cancer resource of comprehensively annotated subclonal events from whole-genome sequencing data.},

abstract = {A major obstacle in precision cancer medicine is the inevitable resistance to targeted therapies. Tremendous effort and progress has been made over the past few years to understand the biochemical and genetic mechanisms underlying drug resistance, with the goal to eventually overcome such daunting challenges. Diverse mechanisms, such as secondary mutations, oncogene bypass, and epigenetic alterations, can all lead to drug resistance, and the number of known involved genes is growing rapidly, thus providing many possibilities to overcome resistance. The finding of these mechanisms and genes invariably requires the application of genomic and functional genomic approaches to tumors or cancer models. In this review, we briefly highlight the major drug-resistance mechanisms known today, and then focus primarily on the technological approaches leading to the advancement of this field. The emergence of drug resistance is a recurrent theme in targeted cancer therapies; thus, the understanding and conquering of drug resistance have become focal points in precision cancer medicine.While the biochemical and genetic mechanisms underlying drug resistance are diverse and complex, the state-of-art technologies (high-throughput sequencing, functional genomics, model systems, etc.) leading to the understanding of such mechanisms have been a consistent force driving the advancement of this field.Although many genes have been found to impact drug resistance, the limited convergence from multiple studies indicates that we are still at the beginning stage of unearthing the entire drug-resistance repertoire. New genomic technologies, preclinical models, and computational methodologies are poised to further accelerate the development of this new field.},

abstract = { Here we advocate Cancer Community Ecology as a valuable focus of study in Cancer Biology. We hypothesize that the heterogeneity and characteristics of cancer cells within tumors should vary systematically in space and time and that cancer cells form local ecological communities within tumors. These communities possess limited numbers of species determined by local conditions, with each species in a community possessing predictable traits that enable them to cope with their particular environment and coexist with each other. We start with a discussion of concepts and assumptions that ecologists use to study closely related species. We then discuss the competitive exclusion principle as a means for knowing when two species should not coexist, and as an opening towards understanding how they can. We present the five major categories of mechanisms of coexistence that operate in nature and suggest that the same mechanisms apply towards understanding the diversification and coexistence of cancer cell species. They are: Food-Safety Tradeoffs, Diet Choice, Habitat Selection, Variance Partitioning, and Competition-Colonization Tradeoffs. For each mechanism, we discuss how it works in nature, how it might work in cancers, and its implications for therapy. }

abstract = {We examined cell size correlations between tissues, and cell size to body mass relationships in passerine birds, amphibians and mammals. The size correlated highly between all cell types in birds and amphibians; mammalian tissues clustered by size correlation in three tissue groups. Erythrocyte size correlated well with the volume of other cell types in birds and amphibians, but poorly in mammals. In birds, body mass correlated positively with the size of all cell types including erythrocytes, and in mammals only with the sizes of some cell types. Size of mammalian erythrocytes correlated with body mass only within the most taxonomically uniform group of species (rodents and lagomorphs). Cell volume increased with body mass of birds and mammals to less than 0.3 power, indicating that body size evolved mostly by changes in cell number. Our evidence suggests that epigenetic mechanisms determining cell size relationships in tissues are conservative in birds and amphibians, but less stringent in mammals. The patterns of cell size to body mass relationships we obtained challenge some key assumptions of fractal and cellular models used by allometric theory to explain mass-scaling of metabolism. We suggest that the assumptions in both models are not universal, and that such models need reformulation.},

abstract = {An evolutionary perspective can help unify disparate observations and make testable predictions. We consider an evolutionary model in relation to two mechanistic frameworks of cancer biology: multistage carcinogenesis and the hallmarks of cancer. The multistage model predicts that cancer risk increases with body size and longevity; however, this is not observed across species (Peto's paradox), but the paradox is resolved by invoking the evolution of additional genetic mechanisms to suppress cancer in large, long-lived species. It is when cancer cells overcome these defence mechanisms that they exhibit the hallmarks of cancer, driving the ongoing evolution of these defences, which in turn is expected to create the differences observed in the genetics of cancer across species and tissues. To illustrate the utility of an evolutionary model we examined some recently published data linking stem-cell divisions and cancer incidence across a range of tissues and show why the original analysis was faulty, and demonstrate that the data are consistent with a multistage model varying from three to seven mutational hits across different tissues. Finally, we demonstrate how an evolutionary model can both define patterns of inherited (familial) cancer and explain the prevalence of cancer in post-reproductive years, including the dominance of epithelial cancers.},

abstract = {Multicellularity evolved independently in multiple lineages, yielding organisms with a wide range of adult sizes. Building an intact soma is not a trivial task, when dividing cells accumulate damage. Here, we study “ontogenetic management strategies,” that is rules of dividing, differentiating and killing somatic cells, to examine two questions: first, do these rules evolve differently for organisms differing in the target mature body size, and second, how well a strategy evolved in small-bodied organisms performs if implemented in a large body—and vice versa (“large”-evolved strategies in small bodies). We model the growth and mature lifespan of an organism starting from a single cell and optimize, using a genetic algorithm, trait combinations across a range of target sizes, with seven evolving traits: (a) probability of asymmetric division, (b) probability of differentiation (per symmetric cell division), (c) Hayflick limit, (d) damage response threshold, (e) damage response strength, (f) number of differentiation steps and (g) division propensity of cells relative to “stemness.” Some but not all traits evolve differently depending on body size: large-bodied organisms perform best with a smaller probability of differentiation, a larger number of differentiation steps on the way to form a tissue and a higher threshold of cellular damage to trigger cell death, than small organisms. Strategies evolved in large organisms are more robust: they maintain high performance across a wide range of body sizes, while those that evolved in smaller organisms fail when attempting to create a large body. This highlights an asymmetry: under various risks of developmental failure and cancer, it is easier for a lineage to become miniaturized (should selection otherwise favour this) than to increase in size.},

abstract = {Progressive telomere shortening from cell division (replicative aging) provides a barrier for human tumor progression. This program is not conserved in laboratory mice, which have longer telomeres and constitutive telomerase. Wild species that do/do not use replicative aging have been reported, but the evolution of different phenotypes and a conceptual framework for understanding their uses of telomeres is lacking. We examined telomeres/telomerase in cultured cells from {\textgreater}60 mammalian species to place different uses of telomeres in a broad mammalian context. Phylogeny-based statistical analysis reconstructed ancestral states. Our analysis suggested that the ancestral mammalian phenotype included short telomeres ({\textless}20kb, as we now see in humans) and repressed telomerase. We argue that the repressed telomerase was a response to a higher mutation load brought on by the evolution of homeothermy. With telomerase repressed, we then see the evolution of replicative aging. Telomere length inversely correlated with lifespan, while telomerase expression co-evolved with body size. Multiple independent times smaller, shorter-lived species changed to having longer telomeres and expressing telomerase. Trade-offs involving reducing the energetic/cellular costs of specific oxidative protection mechanisms (needed to protect {\textless}20kb telomeres in the absence of telomerase) could explain this abandonment of replicative aging. These observations provide a conceptual framework for understanding different uses of telomeres in mammals, support a role for human-like telomeres in allowing longer lifespans to evolve, demonstrate the need to include telomere length in the analysis of comparative studies of oxidative protection in the biology of aging, and identify which mammals can be used as appropriate model organisms for the study of the role of telomeres in human cancer and aging. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

abstract = {Larger organisms have more potentially carcinogenic cells, tend to live longer and require more ontogenic cell divisions. Therefore, intuitively one might expect cancer incidence to scale with body size. Evidence from mammals, however, suggests that the cancer risk does not correlate with body size. This observation defines "Peto's paradox." Here, we propose a novel hypothesis to resolve Peto's paradox. We suggest that malignant tumors are disadvantaged in larger hosts. In particular, we hypothesize that natural selection acting on competing phenotypes among the cancer cell population will tend to favor aggressive "cheaters" that then grow as a tumor on their parent tumor, creating a hypertumor that damages or destroys the original neoplasm. In larger organisms, tumors need more time to reach lethal size, so hypertumors have more time to evolve. So, in large organisms, cancer may be more common and less lethal. We illustrate this hypothesis in silico using a previously published hypertumor model. Results from the model predict that malignant neoplasms in larger organisms should be disproportionately necrotic, aggressive, and vascularized than deadly tumors in small mammals. These predictions may serve as the basis on which to test the hypothesis, but to our knowledge, no one has yet performed a systematic investigation of comparative necrosis, histopathology, or vascularization among mammalian cancers.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Carcinogenesis affects not only humans but almost all metazoan species. Understanding the rules driving the occurrence of cancers in the wild is currently expected to provide crucial insights into identifying how some species may have evolved efficient cancer resistance mechanisms. Recently the absence of correlation across species between cancer prevalence and body size (coined as Peto's paradox) has attracted a lot of attention. Indeed, the disparity between this null hypothesis, where every cell is assumed to have an identical probability to undergo malignant transformation, and empirical observations is particularly important to understand, due to the fact that it could facilitate the identification of animal species that are more resistant to carcinogenesis than expected. Moreover it would open up ways to identify the selective pressures that may be involved in cancer resistance. However, Peto's paradox relies on several questionable assumptions, complicating the interpretation of the divergence between expected and observed cancer incidences.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDISCUSSIONS: Here we review and challenge the different hypotheses on which this paradox relies on with the aim of identifying how this null hypothesis could be better estimated in order to provide a standard protocol to study the deviation between theoretical/theoretically predicted and observed cancer incidence. We show that due to the disproportion and restricted nature of available data on animal cancers, applying Peto's hypotheses at species level could result in erroneous conclusions, and actually assume the existence of a paradox. Instead of using species level comparisons, we propose an organ level approach to be a more accurate test of Peto's assumptions. The accuracy of Peto's paradox assumptions are rarely valid and/or quantifiable, suggesting the need to reconsider the use of Peto's paradox as a null hypothesis in identifying the influence of natural selection on cancer resistance mechanisms.},

Objective To identify mechanisms for cancer resistance in elephants and compare cellular response to DNA damage among elephants, healthy human controls, and cancer-prone patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). Design, Setting, and Participants A comprehensive survey of necropsy data was performed across 36 mammalian species to validate cancer resistance in large and long-lived organisms, including elephants (n = 644). The African and Asian elephant genomes were analyzed for potential mechanisms of cancer resistance. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from elephants, healthy human controls, and patients with LFS were tested in vitro in the laboratory for DNA damage response. The study included African and Asian elephants (n = 8), patients with LFS (n = 10), and age-matched human controls (n = 11). Human samples were collected at the University of Utah between June 2014 and July 2015. Exposures Ionizing radiation and doxorubicin. Main Outcomes and Measures Cancer mortality across species was calculated and compared by body size and life span. The elephant genome was investigated for alterations in cancer-related genes. DNA repair and apoptosis were compared in elephant vs human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Results Across mammals, cancer mortality did not increase with body size and/or maximum life span (eg, for rock hyrax, 1{\%} [95{\%} CI, 0{\%}-5{\%}]; African wild dog, 8{\%} [95{\%} CI, 0{\%}-16{\%}]; lion, 2{\%} [95{\%} CI, 0{\%}-7{\%}]). Despite their large body size and long life span, elephants remain cancer resistant, with an estimated cancer mortality of 4.81{\%} (95{\%} CI, 3.14{\%}-6.49{\%}), compared with humans, who have 11{\%} to 25{\%} cancer mortality. While humans have 1 copy (2 alleles) of TP53, African elephants have at least 20 copies (40 alleles), including 19 retrogenes (38 alleles) with evidence of transcriptional activity measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. In response to DNA damage, elephant lymphocytes underwent p53-mediated apoptosis at higher rates than human lymphocytes proportional to TP53 status (ionizing radiation exposure: patients with LFS, 2.71{\%} [95{\%} CI, 1.93{\%}-3.48{\%}] vs human controls, 7.17{\%} [95{\%} CI, 5.91{\%}-8.44{\%}] vs elephants, 14.64{\%} [95{\%} CI, 10.91{\%}-18.37{\%}]; P {\textless} .001; doxorubicin exposure: human controls, 8.10{\%} [95{\%} CI, 6.55{\%}-9.66{\%}] vs elephants, 24.77{\%} [95{\%} CI, 23.0{\%}-26.53{\%}]; P {\textless} .001). Conclusions and Relevance Compared with other mammalian species, elephants appeared to have a lower-than-expected rate of cancer, potentially related to multiple copies of TP53. Compared with human cells, elephant cells demonstrated increased apoptotic response following DNA damage. These findings, if replicated, could represent an evolutionary-based approach for understanding mechanisms related to cancer suppression.},

abstract = {The size and metabolic rate of cells affect processes from the molecular to the organismal level. We present a quantitative, theoretical framework for studying relationships among cell volume, cellular metabolic rate, body size, and whole-organism metabolic rate that helps reveal the feedback between these levels of organization. We use this framework to show that average cell volume and average cellular metabolic rate cannot both remain constant with changes in body size because of the well known body-size dependence of whole-organism metabolic rate. Based on empirical data compiled for 18 cell types in mammals, we find that many cell types, including erythrocytes, hepatocytes, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells, follow a strategy in which cellular metabolic rate is body size dependent and cell volume is body size invariant. We suggest that this scaling holds for all quickly dividing cells, and conversely, that slowly dividing cells are expected to follow a strategy in which cell volume is body size dependent and cellular metabolic rate is roughly invariant with body size. Data for slowly dividing neurons and adipocytes show that cell volume does indeed scale with body size. From these results, we argue that the particular strategy followed depends on the structural and functional properties of the cell type. We also discuss consequences of these two strategies for cell number and capillary densities. Our results and conceptual framework emphasize fundamental constraints that link the structure and function of cells to that of whole organisms. {\textcopyright} 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {The intrinsic risk of cancer increases with body size and longevity; however, big long-lived species do not exhibit this increase, a contradiction named Peto's paradox. Five hypotheses potentially resolving this paradox were modeled using the multistage model of carcinogenesis. The five hypotheses were based on (1) intrinsic changes in metabolic rate with body size; adaptive increase in immune policing of (2) cancer cells or (3) cells with driver mutations; or adaptive increase in cancer suppression via (4) decreased somatic mutation rate, or (5) increased genetic control. Parameter changes needed to stabilize cancer risk in three types of cancer were estimated for tissues scaled from mouse size and longevity to human and blue whale levels. The metabolic rate hypothesis alone was rejected due to a conflict between the required interspecific effect with the observed intraspecific effect of size on cancer risk, but some metabolic change was optionally incorporated in the other models. Necessary parameter changes in immune policing and somatic mutation rate far exceeded values observed; however, natural selection increasing the genetic suppression of cancer was generally consistent with data. Such adaptive increases in genetic control of cancers in large and/or long-lived animals raise the possibility that nonmodel animals will reveal novel anticancer mechanisms.},

abstract = {The naked mole rat (Heterocephalus glaber) displays exceptional longevity, with a maximum lifespan exceeding 30 years. This is the longest reported lifespan for a rodent species and is especially striking considering the small body mass of the naked mole rat. In comparison, a similarly sized house mouse has a maximum lifespan of 4 years. In addition to their longevity, naked mole rats show an unusual resistance to cancer. Multi-year observations of large naked mole-rat colonies did not detect a single incidence of cancer. Here we identify a mechanism responsible for the naked mole rat's cancer resistance. We found that naked mole-rat fibroblasts secrete extremely high-molecular-mass hyaluronan (HA), which is over five times larger than human or mouse HA. This high-molecular-mass HA accumulates abundantly in naked mole-rat tissues owing to the decreased activity of HA-degrading enzymes and a unique sequence of hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2). Furthermore, the naked mole-rat cells are more sensitive to HA signalling, as they have a higher affinity to HA compared with mouse or human cells. Perturbation of the signalling pathways sufficient for malignant transformation of mouse fibroblasts fails to transform naked mole-rat cells. However, once high-molecular-mass HA is removed by either knocking down HAS2 or overexpressing the HA-degrading enzyme, HYAL2, naked mole-rat cells become susceptible to malignant transformation and readily form tumours in mice. We speculate that naked mole rats have evolved a higher concentration of HA in the skin to provide skin elasticity needed for life in underground tunnels. This trait may have then been co-opted to provide cancer resistance and longevity to this species.},

Scattered demographic findings suggest the existence of a late-life mortality plateau in both humans and dipteran insects, seemingly at odds with both prior data and evolutionary theory. Extensions to the evolutionary theory of aging are developed which indicate that such late-life mortality plateaus are to be expected when enough late-life data are collected. This expanded theory predicts late-life mortality plateaus, with both antagonistic pleiotropy and mutation accumulation as driving population genetic mechanisms.},
